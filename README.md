# Data Structures Lab

### Exercise
**Welcome to the Python Data Structures Lab!**

In this lab, you’ll practice working with different data structures in Python, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and more. By manipulating these data structures, you’ll gain a better understanding of how to organize and store data effectively in your Python programs.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Create and modify lists and tuples.
- Utilize dictionaries for more complex data storage.
- Iterate over data structures using loops.
- Apply Python’s slicing and indexing features to access data.

### Getting Started
- For each exercise, copy the provided code into a new Python script file named exercises.py.
- Each exercise includes a function where you will write your code. The function structure helps you focus on working with the specific data structure required.
- Follow the exercise instructions carefully to complete the code.
- After completing each exercise, run python3 exercises.py in your terminal to see the output and test your code.

If you encounter difficulties with the syntax for data structures, review the provided lesson materials or collaborate with your classmates.
